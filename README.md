# Lutrivia

For the second deliverable, you'll be adding state to your components!

Start by mapping out the data in your app. What should change over time?

User story:

* When a user clicks on an answer
  * In the Question component
  * The answer should highlight green if correct and red if incorrect
  * In the Question component

<!-- You are going to be building Lutrivia! This is intended to be a a bare bones project that is designed to have you practice passing props down from the App component to your other components.

FIRST, come up with a component hierarchy that makes sense and format your data in a way that also makes sense.

SECOND, build out a static version of this. When you are finished your app should look like the image below.

Good luck. When you are finished, jump back on labs! -->
